##-------- First you have to install or make sure ibus and  ibus-m17n is installed. If not then install it.

1. For Fedora: sudo dnf install ibus ibus-m17n
2. For Debian: sudo apt install ibus ibus-m17n
3. For Arch: sudo pacman -S ibus ibus-m17n
4. For Void: sudo xbps-install ibus ibus-m17n


##-------- Now download and unzip the (the bijoy linux.zip) file. I suggest you to download from official website paying 100/-.

After downloading, unzip the file and follow these steps:

1. cd into Bijoy Linux folder using terminal or open the folder in your file manager.
2. Open a terminal in that folder and copy-paste the following commands:

- sudo cp bn-bijoyClassic.mim /usr/share/m17n/
- sudo cp bn-bijoyClassic.png /usr/share/m17n/icons/

3. Open this folder: /usr/share/ibus-m17n/ either by your file manager or using terminal.

4. Open defaults.xml in your preferred text editor (nano,micro,vim,geany,gedit,kate etc) and add these lines before the last </engine>

	<engine>
		<name>m17n:bn-bijoyClassic:*</name>
		<rank>1</rank>
	</engine>

N.B. - Do this carefully maintaining the correct line alignment.

5. Open Downloaded Bijoy Folder again and enter into the fonts folder.
6. Install SutonnyMJ font or your fonts of choice --- This is very important.
7. Log out and log back in.
8. In the ibus preferences, add bn-bijoyClassic.
9. Finally, You have Bijoy Classic keyboard in your Linux system.

10. Use only if you need it badly!
Linux is free and open source and it has a wide range of convenient and better Bangla keyboards with much modern Unicode system.

## N.B. -- You can write Bangla in Bijoy Classic only using the ANSI fonts like SutonnyMJ. If you like to install Bijoy Unicode then the
steps will be the same; just change bn-bijoyClassic with bn-bijoyUnicode.
