##-------- First you have to install or make sure ibus and  ibus-m17n is installed. If not then install it.

1. For Fedora: sudo dnf install ibus ibus-m17n
2. For Debian: sudo apt install ibus ibus-m17n
3. For Arch: sudo pacman -S ibus ibus-m17n
4. For Void: sudo xbps-install ibus ibus-m17n


##-------- Now download and unzip the (the bijoy linux.zip) file. I suggest you to download from official website paying 100/-.

After downloading, unzip the file and follow these steps:

1. cd into Bijoy Linux folder using terminal or open the folder in your file manager.
2. Open a terminal in that folder by right clicking and selecting open terminal here and copy-paste the following commands one by one:

- sudo cp bn-bijoyClassic.mim /usr/share/m17n/
- sudo cp bn-bijoyClassic.png /usr/share/m17n/icons/
- sudo cp bn-bijoyUnicode.mim /usr/share/m17n/
- sudo cp bn-bijoyUnicode.png /usr/share/m17n/icons/

3. Open Downloaded Bijoy Folder again and enter into the fonts folder.
4. Install SutonnyMJ font or your fonts of choice --- This is very important as you can write Bangla in Bijoy Classic only using the ANSI fonts like SutonnyMJ.
5. Log out and log back in Or restart ibus.
6. In the ibus preferences, add bn-bijoyClassic and bijoyUnicode.
7. Finally, You have Bijoy keyboard in your Linux system.

8. Use only if you need it badly!
Linux is free and open source and it has a wide range of convenient and better Bangla keyboards with much modern Unicode system.

## Extra Steps (Not required usually)

1. Open this folder: /usr/share/ibus-m17n/ either by your file manager or using terminal.

2. Open defaults.xml in your preferred text editor (nano,micro,vim,geany,gedit,kate etc) and add these lines before the last </engine>

	<engine>
		<name>m17n:bn-bijoyClassic:*</name>
		<rank>1</rank>
	</engine>

N.B. - Do this carefully maintaining the correct line alignment.
